Automating client onboarding saves time, reduces errors, and improves client satisfaction. By using tools like Typeform, Zapier, and Notion, you can eliminate repetitive tasks, such as form submissions, CRM updates, and document management.

## Time and Money Lost in Manual Onboarding

Manual onboarding tasks can get expensive fast. At an hourly rate of $50 for professional services, these tasks can rack up $750 in labor costs per month. That's $9,000 a year spent on work that automation could handle.

Common manual tasks and their issues:
- Form Collection: Missing information and follow-up emails
- CRM Updates: Errors in data entry and duplicate records
- Welcome Materials: Delays and inconsistent messaging
- Document Management: Lost files and version control issues

## Key Tools for Automation

### 1. Typeform: Collect Client Information
- Interactive forms
- Conditional logic
- Mobile-friendly design
- File upload options

### 2. Zapier: Automate Your Workflows
- Move Typeform responses into your CRM
- Set up new client projects
- Send personalized welcome emails
- Keep client data synced

### 3. Notion: Centralized Client Dashboard
- Custom templates
- Document sharing
- Project updates
- Collaboration tools

## 5 Steps to Set Up Automation

1. Build Your Intake Form
2. Set Up CRM Integration
3. Create Welcome Messages
4. Set Up Client Portal
5. Track and Improve Results

Monitor these key metrics:
- Time-to-Onboard

Start small, test workflows, and improve as you go. The goal is to create a smooth, professional experience that saves time for both you and your clients.
